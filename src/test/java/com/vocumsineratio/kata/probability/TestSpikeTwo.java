        Write a probability value object. It should contain the following methods:
           Probability CombinedWith(Probability)
           Probability InverseOf()
           Probability Either(Probability)

        if you forget your probability math:
           Either:P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)
           CombinedWith: P(A)P(B)
           InverseOf: 1 - P(A)

        The math is surprisingly not the main part of the exercise.

        The internal state should be held as a decimal. Use TDD when writing this object.

        One last thing. You can't put any getters on the object.  What's the first test to write?
